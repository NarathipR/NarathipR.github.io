					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>Detecting distracted drivers is crucial for enhancing road safety and preventing accidents,
						injuries, and fatalities. It reduces accident rates, preserves human lives, and prevents
						property damage,
						contributing to overall road safety. Integrating technology for detecting distracted driving
						aligns with advancements in driver assistance systems.
						This project aims to contribute significantly to road safety by addressing the critical issue of
						distracted driving.
						Our methodology involves a thorough investigation of two distinct approaches for detecting
						instances of
						distracted driving: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Pose Estimation.
					</p>

					<hr class="major" />
					<h2>Goal</h2>
					<p> The specific objectives include the development of a CNN model (Method 1) to detect driver
						behavior and upper body pose estimation to
						assess the level of driver distraction (Method 2).</p>

					<hr class="major" />
					<h2>Dataset</h2>
					<h3>State Farm Distracted Driver Detection | Kaggle [1] </h3>
					<dl>
						<dd>
							<p>There are 22,424 images with 10 classes taken from the front console and the size is 640
								x 480 pixels. The classes include normal driving(C0), texting - right(C1), talking on
								the phone - right(C2), texting - left(C3), talking on the phone - left(C4), operating
								the radio(C5), drinking(C6), reaching behind(C7), hair and makeup(C8), talking to
								passengers(C9). This dataset is used in CNN-based approach and Pose detection using
								Upper Body. For the CNN approach, the data is divided into 3 sets: training set 70%,
								validation set 15%, and test set 15%.</p>

						</dd>


						<hr class="major" />

						<h2>Method</h2>
						<dl>

							<h3>CNN-based</h3>
							<dd>
								<p>The image processing pipeline comprises steps as follows. In Step 1, Image
									Preprocessing, input images undergo cropping and resizing to 64 x 64 pixels.
									Additionally, an optional grayscale conversion is implemented to reduce trainable
									parameters, thereby optimizing computational resources. Step 2, Data Augmentation is
									applied to augment input images, enhancing the model's robustness through rotations,
									zoom, width shift and height shift. In Step 3, Model Training, the training set is
									utilized for model training, employing a spectrum of architectures including
									Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), VGG16-based CNN, ResNet50-based CNN, and
									ResNet101-based CNN. Concluding the process in Step 4, Model Testing evaluates the
									trained model's accuracy across diverse architectures.
								</p>

							</dd>

							<h3>Pose Estimation Based</h3>
							<dd>
								<p>The approach laid out in Fig.1 harnesses the capabilities of Mediapipe Pose Detection
									to detect various driver behaviors, leveraging pose landmarks and criteria set for
									different distractions. It involves specifying landmarks and their spatial
									relationships to identify distracted driving instances accurately. The thresholds
									for each distracted scenario were based primarily on trial and error and then
									secondarily on training images from the State Farm Dataset. The thresholds were
									fine-tuned until the system was able to identify behaviors based on specific
									scenarios and gestures. </p>

						<h2>Result</h2>
						<dl>

							<h3>CNN-based</h3>
							<dd>
								<p>After the training process, it was observed that models with simple CNN demonstrated
									the best performance compared to the other methods. The CNN with grayscale images
									achieved an accuracy of 97.9%, while the CNN with RGB images achieved an accuracy of
									97.7%. Furthermore, each label exhibited a prediction accuracy of over 93%.
									Additionally, when the driver is distracted, both models demonstrated a high
									detection accuracy of 99.9%. In terms of image input, the
									evaluation suggests
									that grayscale images retain meaningful features, providing comparable results with
									a smaller data size.
									Regarding training time, it is notable that the simple CNNs achieve a 90%
									convergence much faster than models employing the transfer learning
									method.
									The simple CNNs reach 90% accuracy within the first 20 epochs,
									a substantial improvement compared to the transfer learning approach.

						<h2>Discussion and Conclusions</h2>
						<p>Advantages of utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for distracted driver detection
							are evident in their outstanding performance,
							particularly with simple CNN models that outperform counterparts like Resnet50, Resnet101,
							and VGG16 in transfer learning scenarios.
							The simplicity of CNNs results in quicker convergence, achieving 90% accuracy on the
							validation set within 20 epochs,
							highlighting their ease of training. Additionally, the reduced number of trainable
							parameters in simple CNNs minimizes the risk of overfitting,
							making them well-suited for various applications. Moreover, CNNs showcase strengths in
							capturing meaningful patterns through filters
							and demonstrating translation invariance, allowing for effective recognition of movements
							irrespective of their position.
							This translation invariance, coupled with reduced sensitivity to spatial variability,
							enhances CNNs' robustness in handling diverse spatial patterns.
							Furthermore, the automatic feature learning capability of CNNs eliminates the need for
							manual feature engineering. </p>

						<p>However, despite these advantages, applying CNNs to this task presents some challenges. The
							computational intensity of convolutional operations demands substantial resources, resulting
							in time-consuming and resource-intensive training. The training process also requires ample
							memory, posing limitations, especially in resource-constrained environments. Additionally,
							the need for large datasets for effective training and interpretability challenges
							associated with complex neural networks are factors that need consideration when working
							with the model.</p>
						<p>For Mediapipe Pose detection using Upper Body we also encountered multiple challenges.
							Specifically, identifying distinct distracted driving behaviors like texting or reaching
							behind using pose landmarks alone proved challenging due to pose variations, lighting
							disparities, and occlusions. The model generated false positives and missed certain
							instances due to the complexity of the hand positions. For example, in a lot of cases, it
							was difficult for the module to identify the arms correctly which led to false positives.
						</p>
						<p>While the analysis yielded insights into using Mediapipe Pose Detection for distracted
							driving detection, the results highlight the complexities and challenges in solely relying
							on pose landmarks only to identify the driver’s arm, eyes or mouth. Since this approach
							solely relies on pose landmarks, which might not capture all subtleties or contexts of
							distracted driving behavior therefore CNN can be considered much better for checking if the
							driver is distracted as it achieves an accuracy of 90%.
