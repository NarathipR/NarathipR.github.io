						<h2>Mask R-CNN for Pulmonary Embolism Detection</h2>

					<div class="box">
						<p>The study explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), specifically ResNet50 and
							ResNet101 architectures within Mask R-CNN, for identifying blood clots in lung arteries
							using CT images.
							While ResNet101 shows slightly better average precision than ResNet50, it requires an
							additional hour of training time, indicating that deeper architectures offer marginal
							performance gains with

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>The CDC reports that annually, 900,000 Americans suffer from blood clot conditions, resulting in
						100,000 deaths and $10 billion in costs. Known as Pulmonary Embolism (PE), this condition
						involves blood clots in pulmonary arteries. Traditional diagnosis relies on blood
						tests or medical imaging, but shortages of specialized personnel necessitate image
						classification to alleviate doctors' workload. Medical imaging techniques like X-ray, CT,
						Ultrasound, and MRI are crucial for diagnosis, with early detection potentially reducing the
						death rate to 3-8%. Implementing convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image classification,
						particularly in identifying blood clots in lung arteries using CT images, is recommended. The
						study compares ResNet50 and ResNet101 architectures within Mask R-CNN to evaluate effectiveness
						and explore enhancements.</p>


					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Dataset</h2>
					<p>The data set is from the public dataset of CT Scan
						images called FUMPE (Ferdowsi University of Mashhad's
						PE dataset) [1]. This dataset is collected from 35
						patients including 17 men and 18 women aged 24-82
						years old. The size of the images is 512 x 512 pixels.
						The images are divided into three sets: training set,
						validation set and test set. As the pictures are in DICOM
						format (Digital Imaging and Communications in
						Medicine), they have to be converted into JPEG format
						first. Before feeding to the model, the images are augmented
						by flipping left and right with a probability of 0.5.</p>






					<hr class="major" />
					<h2>Result</h2>

					<p>The training process takes around six hours for 40
						epochs. As training progresses with each epoch, the
						losses of all cases continue to decrease which means
						that they are converging. The test set is then used to test the performance of each
						case. Evaluation indicator in this study is Average Precision
						(AP) which AP50 and AP75 are focused on. For comparison between ResNet50 and ResNet101, the
						model with ResNet101 has
						slightly higher average precision and both models
						achieve almost AP50 of 80.</p>

					<h2>Discusion and Conclusion</h2>
					<p>According to the result in Table.1 , implementation
						of ResNet50 and ResNet101 do not
						have a significant difference in average precision. The
						average precision of the model with ResNet101
						is slightly better than the model with ResNet50
						by 0.9. However, the training time for ResNet101 is approximately one hour longer than that for
						ResNet50. It can be concluded that
						ResNet with more layers contributes to marginally
						higher performance, but more training time is required. Therefore, the number of layers has
						little impact on the outcome. Compared with baseline1 which</p>
					<p>In terms of limitation, first, CPU and GPU can handle a certain amount of data. As the model
						consumes
						abundant resources during training so the error of
						“Out of Memory” keeps occurring. Therefore, model
						parameters have to be adjusted periodically. Second,
						the dataset contains only 35 patients which still considers a small data set so the trained
						model may not
						generalize well with unseen data.</p>
